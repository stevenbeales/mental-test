<p>@!macro [attach] thread_pool_executor</p>

<pre>An abstraction composed of one or more threads and a task queue. Tasks
(blocks or `proc` objects) are submitted to the pool and added to the queue.
The threads in the pool remove the tasks and execute them in the order
they were received.

A `ThreadPoolExecutor` will automatically adjust the pool size according
to the bounds set by `min-threads` and `max-threads`. When a new task is
submitted and fewer than `min-threads` threads are running, a new thread
is created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are idle.
If there are more than `min-threads` but less than `max-threads` threads
running, a new thread will be created only if the queue is full.

Threads that are idle for too long will be garbage collected, down to the
configured minimum options. Should a thread crash it, too, will be garbage collected.

`ThreadPoolExecutor` is based on the Java class of the same name. From
the official Java documentation;

&gt; Thread pools address two different problems: they usually provide
&gt; improved performance when executing large numbers of asynchronous tasks,
&gt; due to reduced per-task invocation overhead, and they provide a means
&gt; of bounding and managing the resources, including threads, consumed
&gt; when executing a collection of tasks. Each ThreadPoolExecutor also
&gt; maintains some basic statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.
&gt;
&gt; To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class provides many
&gt; adjustable parameters and extensibility hooks. However, programmers are
&gt; urged to use the more convenient Executors factory methods
&gt; [CachedThreadPool] (unbounded thread pool, with automatic thread reclamation),
&gt; [FixedThreadPool] (fixed size thread pool) and [SingleThreadExecutor] (single
&gt; background thread), that preconfigure settings for the most common usage
&gt; scenarios.</pre>
