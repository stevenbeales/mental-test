HEAD
-------

1.0.0.rc1
---------

NOTE: documentation & requirements/compatibility are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/thbar/kiba/wiki).

- New: `SQLUpsert` destination allowing row-by-row "insert or update".
- New: `SQL` source allowing efficient streaming of large volumes of SQL rows while controlling memory consumption.
- Improvement: `SQLBulkInsert` can now be used from a Sidekiq job.

0.9.0
-----

- Multiple improvements to `SQLBulkInsert`:
  - New flexible `row_pre_processor` option which allows to either remove a row conditionally (useful to conditionally target a given destination amongst many) or to replace it by N dynamically computed target rows.
  - New callbacks: `after_initialize` & `before_flush` (useful to enforce dependent destinations flush & ensure required foreign keys constraints are respected).
  - `logger` support.
  - Bugfix: make sure to `disconnect` on `close`.
  - Extra safety checks on row keys.

0.4.0
-----

- Initial release of the `SQLBulkInsert` destination (providing fast SQL INSERT).
