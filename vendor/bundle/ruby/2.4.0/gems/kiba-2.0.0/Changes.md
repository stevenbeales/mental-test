2.0.0.rc1
---------

- New (opt-in) StreamingRunner allows class transforms to generate more than one row. See [#44](https://github.com/thbar/kiba/pull/44) for rationale & how to activate.
- Potentially breaking change if you were using the internal class `Kiba::Parser` directly: ETL jobs parsing has been modified to improve the isolation between the evaluation scope and the Kiba classes. See [#46](https://github.com/thbar/kiba/pull/46) for more information.

1.0.0
-----

- `close` becomes optional in destinations.
- Bumping to 1.0.0 since Kiba is in wide production use.

0.6.1
-----

- Bugfix: make sure files generated by `pre_process` can safely be read from constructor of sources [#16]. Thanks @bcherrington for catching this.
- Internal refactoring of processing engine (should not affect regular use)

0.6.0
-----
