# Alexa Verifier

[AlexaVerifier][alexa_verifier] is a gem created to verify that requests received within a [Rack][rack]-based application originate from Amazon's Alexa API.

This gem is framework agnostic and should work with any Rack based application including both [Rails][rails] and [Sinatra][sinatra].

## Requirements
[AlexaVerifier][alexa_verifier] requires the following:
* [Ruby][ruby] - version 2.0 or greater


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'alexa_verifier'
```


## Usage
This gem's main function is taking an [Rack][rack] request and verifying that it was sent by Amazon.

### Sinatra
```ruby
# within server.rb (or equivalent)

post '/' do
  AlexaVerifier.valid!(request)
end
```


### Rails
```ruby
# config/routes.rb

post '/', to: 'alexa#index'
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/alexa_controller.rb

class AlexaController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token, only: :index

  def index
    AlexaVerifier.valid!(request)
  end
end
```

### Methods
[AlexaVerifier][alexa_verifier] has two main entry points, detailsed below:

Method | Parameter type | Returns
---|---|---
`AlexaVerifier.valid!(request)` | Rack-based request object | `true` on successful verification. Raises an error if unsuccessful.
`AlexaVerifier.valid?(request)` | Rack-based request object | `true` on successful verificatipn. `false` if unsuccessful.

You are also able to configure [AlexaVerifier][alexa_verifier] to disable some checks. This is detailed in the section below.


### Disabling checks
If you'd like to disable one (or more) of the checks performed by [AlexaVerifier][alexa_verifier], you can do so by passing a #configure block. Each of the configuration attributes are Boolean values and are detailed below.

It is possible to disable checks either globally, or for a specific instance. This is useful if you want to run multiple instances of the verifier within your application.

Option | Default | Description
---|---|---
`enabled` | `true` | Enables or disables AlexaVerifier checks. This setting overrides all others i.e. setting `config.enabled = false` disables all checks even if you set others to true.
`verify_uri` | `true` | Enables or disables checks on the certificate URI. Set to `false` to allow serving of certificates from non-amazon approved domains.
`verify_timeliness` | `true` | Enables or disables timeliness checks. Set to `false` to allow requests generated in the past to be executed. Good for serving test requests.
`verify_certificate` | `true` | Enables or disabled checks on whether the certificate is in date, or contains the SAN address we expect.
`verify_signature` | `true` | Enables or disables checks to see if a request was actually signed by a certificate.

#### Examples
The below is an example of a 'complete' configure block, setting attributes both globally and for an individual instance.

##### Globally
```ruby
AlexaVerifier.configure do |config|
  config.enabled            = false # Disables all checks, even though we enable them individually below
  config.verify_uri         = true
  config.verify_timeliness  = true
  config.verify_certificate = true
  config.verify_signature   = true
end
AlexaVerifier.valid!(request)
```

##### Instance level
###### With a block
```ruby
verifier = AlexaVerifier::Verifier.new do |config|
  config.enabled            = false
  config.verify_uri         = true
  config.verify_timeliness  = true
  config.verify_certificate = true
  config.verify_signature   = true
end
verifier.valid!(request)
```

###### Calling `#configure`
```ruby
verifier = AlexaVerifier::Verifier.new
verifier.configure do |config|
  config.enabled            = false
  config.verify_uri         = true
  config.verify_timeliness  = true
  config.verify_certificate = true
  config.verify_signature   = true
end
verifier.valid!(request)
```


### Handling errors
AlexaVerifier#valid! will raise one of the following *expected* errors if verification cannot be performed.

> Please note that all errors come with (hopefully) helpful accompanying messages.

Error | Description
---|---
`AlexaVerifier::InvalidCertificateURIError` | Raised when the certificate URI does not pass validation.
`AlexaVerifier::InvalidCertificateError` | Raised when the certificate itself does not pass validation e.g. out of date, does not contain the requires SAN extension, etc.
`AlexaVerifier::InvalidRequestError` | Raised when the request cannot be verified (not timely, not signed with the certificate, etc.)
